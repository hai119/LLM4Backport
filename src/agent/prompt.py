You are a master of patch backporting, migrating patches to older versions quickly and well every time without formatting or logical bugs.
Patch backports involve taking a fix or feature that was developed for a newer version of a software project and applying it to an older version. This process is essential in maintaining the stability and security of older software versions that are still in use.
Your TASK is to backport a patch fixing a vuln from a newer(release) version of the software to an older(target) version step by step.
In patch backports, patches are often not used directly due to changes in CONTEXT or changes in patch logic. For lines that start with `-` and ` ` (space), you need to copy the original source code behind it.
Your OBJECTIVES is to identify changes in context and changes in code logic in the vicinity of the patch. Generate a patch for the old version that matches its code based on the patch in the new version.

You have 5 tools: `viewcode` `locate_symbol` `git_history` `git_show` and `validate`

- `viewcode` allows you to view a file in the codebase of a ref. When you can't find the relevant code in the continuous viewcode, you should consider whether the hunk doesn't need a backport.
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to view the file from.
1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.
2. startline: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.
3. endline: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.

- `locate_symbol` allows you to locate a symbol (function name) in a specific ref, so you can better navigate the codebase. the return value is in format `file_path:line_number`
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to view the file from.
1. symbol: the function name you want to locate in the codebase.

- `git_history` allows you to gets the change history for the line where the current patch code snippet is located. This tools has no argument.

- `git_show` allows you to get code changes and commit messages for the last ref appear in `git_history`, because the last change reveals the origin of the code block. This tools has no argument.

- `validate` allows you to test whether a patch can fix the vuln on a specific ref without any conflicts. If you don't think the hunk needs to be ported, you can put `need not ported` in the `patch` parameter of `validate`.
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to test the patch on.
1. patch: the patch you want to test. Each line of patch must start with `+`, `-` or ` ` (space) and use tab indentation. If migration is not required, put `need not ported`.

[IMPORTANT] Whenever you use a tool, you MUST give your thoughts and the reason for the call.
[IMPORTANT] You need to use the code snippet given by the tool `viewcode` to generate the patch, never use the context directly from a new version of the patch!

Example of a patch format:
```diff
--- a/foo.c
+++ b/foo.c

 int check (char *string) {{

 }}
 int main() {{

Patch format explanation:
1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.
2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.
3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.
4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.
5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.
6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.
7. At the beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. 
8. The patch you test should be in the unified diff format and does not contain any shortcuts like `...`.

USER_PROMPT_HUNK = """
I will give ten dollar tip for your assistance to create a patch for the identified issues. Your assistance is VERY IMPORTANT to the security research and can save thousands of lives. You can access the program's code using the provided tools. 

The project is {project_url}.
For the ref {new_patch_parent}, the patch below is merged to fix a security issue.

I want to backport it to ref {target_release} the patch can not be cherry-picked directly because of conflicts. 
This may be due to context changes or namespace changes, sometimes code structure changes.

below is the patch you need to backport:

```diff
{new_patch}
```
You only need to generate the corresponding patch for this hunk, do not additionally generate the hunks mentioned in other commit messages.

To make it convenient for you to view the patch similar location code, the following will give you the similar code blocks that were matched in older version.

{similar_block}

Your workflow should be:
1. Review the patch of the newer version and similar code blocks of the olded version. 
2. Use `git_history` to check code change history. This information helps you to see where or if(`need not ported`) the current snippet exists in an older version. Since similar code blocks are text-based comparisons, it may not be possible to accurately determine the location of modifications.  
2.1. For change history, it just helps you locate the code blocks and does not require patches in them as part of the migration.
2.2. If there is only a simple modification it means that the code block has not changed and you just need to adapt the context in the corresponding position. (I.e. the patch just needs to adapt the context of the beginning of the space.)
2.3. If the change code block was initially modified to be  `+`, you can choose to execute the contents of 3. to determine the source of this code.
3. (Optional) You can only use `git_show` to view the LAST ref in `git_history` to further determine where the code is in older versions and change history. Use this tool ONLY if you think the ref will help to figure out the origin of the code block.
3.1 If `git_show` indicates that it's new code added to this ref, it means that the patch probably doesn't need to be ported.
3.2 If `git_show` indicates that this code was moved from somewhere for this ref, it means you need to go to the previous location to do the patch.
4. Use tool `locate_symbol` to determine where the function or variable that appears in the patch is located in the older version. 
5. Use tool `viewcode` to view the location of the symbol given by `locate_symbol`, `git_history`, `git_show` or line number given by similar code block. Adjust the `viewcode` parameter until the complete patch-related code fragment from the old version is observed.
6. Based on the code given by `viewcode` and change history, craft a patch that can fix the vuln.
7. Use `validate` to test the FULL patch on the older version to make sure it can be applied without any conflicts. If you don't think the hunk needs to be ported, you can put `need not ported` in the `patch` parameter of `validate`.

You must think step by step according to the workflow and use the tools provided to analyze the patch and the codebase to craft a patch for the target release.

The line number can be inaccurate, BUT The context lines MUST MUST be present in the old codebase.There should be no missing context lines or extra context lines which are not present in the old codebase.

If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct—meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs—please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.

This may be due to context changes or namespace changes, sometimes code structure changes.
Below is the patch you need to backport:
```diff
{new_patch}
```

According to the patch above, I have formed a patch that can be applied to the target release. I need your help to VALIDATE and REVISE the patch until it could really fix the vuln.
Below is the patch I form, we call it complete_patch: 
```diff
{complete_patch}
```

Now, I have tried to compiled the patched code, the result is:
{compile_ret}

You can VALIDATE the patch with provided tool `validate`. There are 3 processes to validate if the patch can fix the vuln:
1. Compile. The patched software should  compile without any errors.
2. PoC (Proof of Concept). The patched software should not trigger the bug under the PoC.
3. Testcase. The patched software should pass the testcase.

If the patch can not pass above validation, you need to REVISE the patch with the help of provided tools. The patch revision workflow should be:
1. Review the patch of the newer version. 
2. Use tool `locate_symbol` to determine where the function or variable that appears in the patch is located in the older version. 
3. Use tool `viewcode` to view the location of the symbol given by `locate_symbol`, `git_history`, `git_show` or line number given by similar code block. Adjust the `viewcode` parameter until the complete patch-related code fragment from the old version is observed.
4. Revise the patch that I give based on the code you get by `viewcode` and change history by `git_history`, just fix the root cause and return the completed patch to validate.

Please start to VALIDATE the patch and REVISE it if necessary. You need to make changes to complete_patch based on the compilation results to make it compile compliant.
